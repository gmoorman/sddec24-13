This is the project repository of Iowa State ECE Senior Design Team SDDEC24-13. The goal of this design team was to develop a research vehicle for silicon, exploring the computational capabilities of a Resistive Random Access Memory (ReRAM or RRAM) crossbar. This circuit was developed in the Skywater SKY130nm process and follows the Efabless design flow which uses the open source tools featured in the caravel harness workflow. 

Currently, the individual components for this project function correctly. Most components have associated layouts that have passed DRC and LVS (Please reference the [Future Work](#FutureWork) for more information). Unfortunatly, these components have not been tested completely as a system due to time constraints.

## General Design <a id="GeneralDesign"></a>



## Setup <a id="Setup"></a>

### General Setup Guide <a id="GeneralSetup"></a>

1) Install the Skywater 130nm PDK
2) Install all relavent software and software dependencies or activate toolchain
3) Pull this repository and replace identical folders in the Analog Caravel Harness repository
4) Install the Analog Caravel Harness repository
5) Set the following enviornment variables as such
```sh
export OPENLANE_ROOT=$(pwd)/path/to/caravel_user_project_analog/dependencies/openlane_src
export PDK=sky130B
export PDK_ROOT=$(pwd)/path/to/caravel_user_project_analog/dependencies/pdks
export PATH="/home/user/.local/bin:$PATH"
```
6) To ensure everything has been installed correctly, you could check the following:
   - Xschem:
      - Launch Xschem in the \xschem directory (Or a directory with .xschemrc) with the following command:

      ```sh
      xschem
      ```
      - Xschem should pull up a schematic "top.sch" that should look like this: \
      ![Xschem top.sch example](README_files/xschem_topsch_ex.PNG "Xschem top.sch example")
   - Magic VLSI
      - Launch Magic VLSI with the sky130B PDK in the \mag folder (or any folder with the file "sky130B.magicrc")  with the following command:
      ```sh
      magic -rcfile sky130B.magicrc
      ```
      - Magic VLSI should pull up with the sky130B technology
      - The Devices 1 and Devices 2 options should be available as well
      - You can test gencell by placing a device, an example of a min sized NMOS looks like this:
      ![Magic VLSI gencell example](README_files/magic_vlsi_ex.PNG "Magic VLSI gencell example")

### Tools <a id="Tools"></a>
This project is confirmed to work on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.10 (Ootpa). \
The tools used in this design enviornment is as follows (The project is confirmed to function with the provided tool versions):

- Xschem v3.4.4
- Ngspice v42
- Magic VLSI v8.3 revision 460
- Netgen v1.5.270
- Openlane v1.1.1
- GTKwave v3.3.118
- Klayout v0.28.16

If you have access to Iowa State University ChipForge's toolchain, version 1.0.4 was used during the development of this project and is confirmed to work. 
At the time of writing this, you can install the toolchain onto the Linux Coover machines with the following command:
```sh
curl -L https://git.ece.iastate.edu/api/v4/projects/6423/packages/generic/toolchain/1.0.4/toolchain.tar.gz | tar xz
```
To activate the toolchain:
```sh
~/toolchain/activate
```
Otherwise, follow the "TODO: Josh Thater's Doc" for further instructions regarding software and software dependency installation.

### Caravel Harness <a id="Carvel"></a>
This project uses the [analog caravel harness repository template](https://github.com/efabless/caravel_user_project_analog) as the main framework. For digital circuit synthesis and hardening, we used the OpenLane workflow from the [digital caravel harness repository template](https://github.com/efabless/caravel).

### PDK <a id="PDK"></a>
The PDK used in this project is the [Skywater SKY130nm](https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk). For ReRAM support, SKY130B will be used. \
To install the PDK on your own system, directions can be found here (TODO: Josh Thater's doc)\
Installing the PDK on the Coover computers can be done through Volare by following these instructions from this document (TODO: Konnor's doc)

1) Update the Makefile located in the */caravel_user_project_analog* directory with the following: \
**IMPORTANT:** These may change with time and youâ€™ll have to monitor or ask on Slack if something has changed.
```sh
MPW_TAG ?= 2024.09.13-1
export OPEN_PDKS_COMMIT?=0fe599b2afb6708d281543108caf8310912f54af
```
 

2) Configure enviornment variables as such:
```sh
export CARAVEL_ROOT=(pwd)/path/to/caravel_user_project_analog/caravel
export PDK=sky130B
export PDK_ROOT="/home/user/PDK"
```

3) Install Volare locally with Python via the following command:
```sh
pip3 install --user volare
```

4) Make the PDK resources with the following command in your */caravel_user_project_analog* directory
```sh
make pdk-with-volare
```
